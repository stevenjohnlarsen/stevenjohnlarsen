### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

My interests and hobbies include.

- Machine learning and Artifial Intelligence
- Full stack engineering 
- C# and dotnet techonologies 
- Well written code 


Here are some projects I have contributed to 
 - Gain Training with discriminator setback. 
  - Proposed and tested a new method to training GANs.
  - [Paper](https://github.com/stevenjohnlarsen/GAN-discriminator-refresh-learning/blob/main/Discriminator_Weight_Stepback.pdf) 
  - [Results](https://nbviewer.org/github/stevenjohnlarsen/GAN-discriminator-refresh-learning/blob/main/GraphsForPaper-No-Feature-Matching.ipynb)
  - [code](https://github.com/stevenjohnlarsen/GAN-discriminator-refresh-learning) 
- Learned Rubiks
  - Created an IPhone application to teach others how to solve a rubiks cube.
  - Alowed users to take various photos of the cube to the application could represent it virtually 
  - Stepped the users through solving the cube (even with their real world case
  - [code](https://github.com/nlarsensmu/LearnedRubiks)
- [Style Transfer](https://nbviewer.org/github/stevenjohnlarsen/StyleTransfer/blob/main/StyleTransfer2.ipynb) 
  - Used whitening and coloring techniques from [Li et al.](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1802.06474.pdf) to transfer the sytle of one image to the content of anther

- [Classifying cancerous brain cell images](https://nbviewer.org/github/nlarsensmu/CNN/blob/master/Merged%20work.ipynb).  
  - Used a custom convulution nerual network to classify whether a brain blood cell was cancerous
